# LuigiKart

This project is bootstrapped off of a Sac State student's Master's design project.
It requires proprietary files to run, which may be distributed upon request.

A video of the running game can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WISRYjgXZ3h_KK2WHgsCrTmfM-eq0jUV/view)
(this race is against 7 NPCs)

All assets in the game were made entirely from scratch with GIMP and Blender, with the exception of the skybox and the music.

The game supports up to 8 networked players.  Any unfilled slots are controlled by AI.
